#+TITLE: The Christmas Compiler

#+begin_quote
Oh syntax tree, oh syntax tree,
How lovely are thy derivations!
#+end_quote

Christmas break is coming up soon, and I all I want for Christmas is a compiler that:

 - Implements a small typed lambda calculus
 - Includes Hindley-Milner type inference
 - Replaces a garbage collector runtime with linear typing
 - Supports continuations
 - Is built with a nanopass framework so I can swap layers out to my liking

I know Santa's busy this year, so I don't know if he'll get around to all those things, but we're going to try. This will be a victory if I learn something.

It will also be a good outlet for some Christmas-related puns.

I am so sorry.

#+begin_quote
Write yourself, some merry little IR,
If the types will check
From now on, this variable is out of scope
And build yourself, a merry little compiler now
