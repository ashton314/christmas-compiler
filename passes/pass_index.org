#+TITLE: Pass Index

This compiler consists of several small passes. Since there are so many, this is an index of those passes so you can figure out easily which pass runs when.

* Passes

 - [[file:parser.rkt][Parser]] :: The first pass is the parser: this turns an external, Racket-hosted s-expression into our internal AST
 - [[file:code_gen.rkt][Code Generation]] :: Final pass is the code generation: this turns the final, processed AST into LLVM IR

This list will grow as time goes on.
